My research aims to improve our understanding of fluid dynamic problems using direct numerical simulation. I have been working on various fluid problems involving shock waves, acoustic waves, bubbles, droplets, and phase change for cavitation, fuel injection, and boiling applications. Multiphase flow problems are of particular interest as they offer many avenues for improving computational and numerical methods.

Currently, I am a postdoctural researcher in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/schools/mechanical/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1t2pBhAFEiwA_-A-NBD2hezc4jsUZIxTiw7qJFjBuPJqY_LBdeUICzzaZguUeL5a2cMpMRoCRckQAvD_BwE). I teach Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), [Heat Transfer](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=ENME315&occurrence=23S2(C)&year=2023),
[Thermodynamics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=ENME215&occurrence=23S1(C)&year=2023), and [Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Engineering](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=ENME465&occurrence=23S1(C)&year=2023).
